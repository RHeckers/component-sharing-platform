# Work in Progress
Creating a platform to upload Angular components, instantly upload them to stackblitz for a live version, easy component copying to clipboard or download as a zip, like and share components or save them as your favorites.

There is still a long way to go, but the uploading, copying, diplaying and so on is already working and connected to a mongoDB database.

## MEAN Stack
I use Node.js and express for a serverside language, Angular for the front end framework and mongoDb for the database.

## Clone instructions
Run git clone 

Setup your own config file with your mongoURI to connect to your own database.

npm i

npm run dev in de root to run the node and front end dev servers
